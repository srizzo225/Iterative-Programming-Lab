# Iterative-Programming-Lab
Module five lab on iterative programming

This repository contains five programs that demonstrate interative programming.

1. 01hello100.py: This program prints Hello World 100 times

2. 02sqnum.py: This program each of the numbers on a new line. Then, it prints each number and its square on a new line.

3. 03polygon.py: This program draws a polygon. It asks the user how many sides the polygon should have, how long the sides should be, the color of the outside line, and the fill color.

4. 04multiples.py: This program goes through the numbers 1-50 and tells you if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If it is divisible by neither, then it just prints the number.

5. 05drawing.py: This program uses the turtle module to draw some flowers
